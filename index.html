            <p><em>Variety Streamer, trying to find his way through life.</em></p>
            <p>My name is Chris H, and I am a variety streamer on <strong>Twitch</strong> as <em><strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mrdragon01">MrDragon01</a></strong></em> My current goal is to learn to be able to code well enough to make it my full-time job as to not drain myself and get back to streaming. I'd like to be able to automate simple tasks within my code, be able to create seamless transitions without outside input for my streams, and learn to create personal macros for any (single player) games that I may enjoy.</p>
